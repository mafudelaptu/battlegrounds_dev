		<p>The Credit-System is the Ban/Report/Commend-System of Dota2-League. . You can upvote or downvote a player for their behavior and play after each match. </p>
<p>All players start with 0(zero) Creditpoints and can gain them by upvoting other players or getting upvoted, and lose them by getting downvoted.
</p>
<p>Here are some facts about the<strong> Up-/Downvote system</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Players are able to give away 10 upvotes and 5 downvotes every week,</li>
  <li>This amount gets automatically reset (back to 10 available upvotes and 5 downvotes) at the beginning of a week (Monday),</li>
  <li>If the number of your available votes drops to 0(zero), you can't up- or downvote anyone else in the current week,</li>
  <li>You can up- or downvote the same player only once per match</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Upvotes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>thumb up: +2</li>
  <li>for each Upvote you gain +1 Credit</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Downvotes:</strong></p>
<ul>
      <li>thumb down: -3</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some facts to Credits:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If you play at least 5 games per day, you will receive +1 upvote and +1 downvote to give away. This does not stack, however (if you play 10 games, the bonus will not be doubled).</li>
  <li>For each upvote you receive from another player you gain Credits.</li>
  <li>For each downvote you receive from another player you lose Credits.</li>
  <li>If you lose at least 30 Credits in one day (0:00-23:59), your Credit points will be set to 0(zero), no matter how many you had previously. This should prevent players with a high amount of Credits from misbehaving.</li>
  <li>If you lose at least 30 Credits in one week (Monday-Sunday), your points will be halved), no matter how many you had previously. This should prevent players with a high amount of Credits from misbehaving.</li>
  <li>You can earn Archievements if you gain enough Credits
    <ul>
      <li>+50 Credits: a bronze thumbs-up icon next to your name,</li>
      <li>+125 Credits: a silver thumbs-up icon next to your name,</li>
      <li>+250 Credits: a gold thumbs-up icon next to your name.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the future the Credit points could be a requirement for joining a special queue, event or tournament</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do bans work?</strong></p>
<p>Bans are automatically given via the Credits-System. If a player reaches a count of -20 Credits they automatically get banned by the Dota2-League system. After the ban has expired, the Credits are reset to 0, and the player is able to start collecting them once again. </p>
<p>A ban indicates that you can't join any queue anymore, but may still browse the website.</p>
<p>Bans  are treated as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ban: Warning</li>
  <li>Ban: 24h ban</li>
  <li>Ban: 3 days ban</li>
  <li>Ban: 7 days ban</li>
  <li>Ban: 21 days ban</li>
  <li>Ban: Permanent ban</li>
</ol>
