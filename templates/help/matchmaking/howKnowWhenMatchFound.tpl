		<p>Dota2-league will play an alert sound once 10 players are found and your match is ready, so you can feel free to browse the web while searching.
However you might need to configure your browser to allow the sound (<a href="soundPlugin.php">test your sound-configuration</a>), or disable NoScript for Dota2-league.</p>
