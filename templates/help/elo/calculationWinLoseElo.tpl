	<p>Each league represents a certain skill-level (roughly) in our Dota2 league, and determines your won and lost points after a successfully played match. The following is a table which shows how many points are won/lost in each league:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" class="table table-striped">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Qualifying</th>
    <th>Bronze</th>
    <th>Silver</th>
    <th>Gold</th>
    <th>Platinum</th>
    <th>Diamond</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>+20 / -10</td>
    <td>+20 / -12</td>
    <td>+20 / -14</td>
    <td>+20 / -16</td>
    <td>+20 / -18</td>
    <td>+20 / -20</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><b>Since patch 0.3, the Qualifying and Bronze leagues have their own matchmaking pool, meaning that players from these leagues can't queue together with players from the Silver league or higher.
