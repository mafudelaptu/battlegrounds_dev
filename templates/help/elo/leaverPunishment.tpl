		How will be Leaver punished? </a></h4>
</div>
<div id="leaverPunishment" class=" collapse in">

		<p>A player will be marked as a leaver if 6 or more players of a match mark him as such after the game has ended. The leaver will always be punished, regardless of whether his team won or lost the match.
<br />
  The punishment looks as follows:&nbsp;</p>
  <p>D2L-Points:<strong> -50 Points</strong></p>
  <p>If you leave a game, you can no longer upload its replay or receive the +1 credit bonus if someone else does the upload.</p>
  <p>The team with the most leavers is considered handicapped.  The remaining players on the handicapped team dont lose any Points if they lose the match. If both teams have the same amount of leavers, Points will be awarded regularly. </p>
