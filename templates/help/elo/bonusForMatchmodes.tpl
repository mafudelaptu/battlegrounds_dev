		There are Bonus-Points provided for playing specific game modes. This will motivate people to play modes other than All-Pick. The following table lists the amount of Bonus-Points given for playing each of the modes:
		<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" class="table table-striped">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Matchmode</th>
 	<th>Bonus-Points</th>
  </tr>

  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>All-Pick</td>
    <td>+0</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Single-Draft</td>
    <td>+1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Captains-Mode</td>
    <td>+5</td>

      <li>3 games won in a row: +5 points</li>
      <li>4 games: +10</li>
      <li>5 games: +20</li>
      <li>6 games and more: 40 (note: +40 is the max bonus)</li>
</ul>
Note: your win streak is not interrupted if you lose a game with a leaver on your team.</p>
