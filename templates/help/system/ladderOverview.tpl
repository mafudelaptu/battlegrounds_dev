		<p>Dota2-League is divided into 6 leagues:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Qualifying</li>
  <li>Bronze</li>
  <li>Silver</li>
  <li>Gold</li>
  <li>Platinum</li>
  <li>Diamond</li>
</ol>
<p>The amount of D2L-Points decides in which league a certain player is, as listed below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Qualifying: 0-199</li>
  <li>Bronze: 200 - 499</li>
  <li>Silver: 500 - 999</li>
  <li>Gold: 1000 - 1749</li>
  <li>Platinum: 1750 - 2999</li>
  <li>Diamond: +3000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Since patch 0.3, the Qualifying and Bronze leagues have their own matchmaking pool, meaning that players from these leagues can't queue together with players from the Silver league or higher.</strong></p>
<p>If you reach the amount of points required in a higher-level league, you automatically level-up.</p>
<p>If you reach the Bronze league, you can't fall back into the Qualifying league anymore.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" class="table table-striped">
<p>Each league represents a certain skill-level (roughly) in our Dota2 league, and determines your won and lost points after a successfully played match. The following is a table which shows how many points are won/lost in each league:</p>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Qualifying</th>
    <th>Bronze</th>
    <th>Silver</th>
    <th>Gold</th>
    <th>Platinum</th>
    <th>Diamond</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>+20 / -10</td>
    <td>+20 / -12</td>
    <td>+20 / -14</td>
    <td>+20 / -16</td>
    <td>+20 / -18</td>
    <td>+20 / -20</td>
  </tr>
